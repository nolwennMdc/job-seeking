\begin{cvletter}

I am currently in my 5th (and last) year of studies at INSA Lyon, one of the best French engineering school, where I specialized in Telecommunications and more precisely in robotics and embedded systems. From mid-february / march 2019 I would like to do my end-of-study internship in your company (it could also be a fixed-term contract) to share a rich and stimulating experience of duration of 6 months.

%\textcolor{green}{YACHTINH COMPANIES} 
%I am highly motivated to work for your company in the nautical domain because I have a close connection to the sea. I was born and I lived on the shore and now, I want to include it in my job. %Doing an internship in a company working in yachting 
%Moreover, I am a passionate from new devices and technologies and I believe I would be a good element in your team, learning and developing side by side with you. 

%\textcolor{green}{ROBOTIC COMPANIES} 
%I am highly motivated to work for your company in the robotic domain because it stimulates my curiosity and my creativity. It also enables me to confront different skills that I developped during my engineer studies such as programming but also some mechanics and mathematics. %that diversity of the job attracts me
%Moreover, I am passionate about new devices and technologies and I believe I would be a good element in your team, learning and developing side by side with you. 
%Ce stage m'offrirait l'opportunité de m'immerger dans le secteur du développement informatique dans le contexte de la transformation digitale des banques européennes, tout en m'ouvrant à l'international. Les objectifs concrets et retombées visibles du travail effectué sont évidemment une source de motivation personnelle et stimulent ma curiosité. Ce projet, qui s'inscrit dans une dynamique mêlant innovation, activités et individus, m'intéresse particulièrement pour sa dimension analytique ainsi que l'accent qu'il porte sur le développement.  %côté humain, autonomisation numérique de nos clients ; citation de Thierre Breton

Thanks to my training at INSA, I have acquired the necessary basics to evolve in an environment combining computer science, networking and information theory. Thanks to the first cycle of 2 years I developed a strong scientific background (in mathematics, physics, mechanics...). Then, in the second cycle of 3 years, I reinforced my qualifications in algorithmic, in programming in different languages (including non-exhaustively Java, C and Python) and contexts (Unix, Windows). During my last year I follow lessons on embedded systems and robotics. I also had the opportunity to experience team work on several projects, including international teams. I have also studied one semester at Chalmers University of Technologies (Sweden) where I learned new ways to solve problems and developed my intercultural communication skills. 
I am now willing to start contributing those skills at a dynamic and innovative company, such as Bravura Solutions.%\textcolor{red}{company name}. 


\vspace{1mm} 

I have already some professional experiences among which I proved my serious and my sense of responsibility. Those experiences brought me also good skills regarding customer relations, like listening and learning to know the client to better answer its expectations. Concerning my technical qualifications, I have contributed within an agile project team to the development of a digital banking platform for equensWorldline, the pan-European leader in payments and transactional services. I therefore think that I have the qualifications to become part of one of your team. My capacity of adaptation, my rigour and my enthusiasm will be my assets to be quickly able to meet my tasks, whether to study and analyze the situation or to develop appropriate solutions.
